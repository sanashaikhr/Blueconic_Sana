BlueConic Bugs/Improvements:

 1 Missing Input Fields When Submitting a New Session:
     The submission process for a new session lacks input fields for capturing the Room Number and Start Time.
	 
 2 Displaying "Null" on UI for Room Number and Start Time:
     Due to the absence of input fields mentioned above, the UI displays "Null" for Room Number and Start Time.
	 
 3 Default Display of Wednesday Sessions on Conference Page:
     Upon landing on the Conference Page, Wednesday sessions are displayed by default instead of showing the complete list of all sessions.
	 
 4  Highlighting Selected Day When Filtering Sessions:
     When filtering sessions by day, the selected day should be visually highlighted to provide clear feedback to the user about their selection.

 5  Inconsistent Behavior in Displaying New Sessions:
     After submitting a new session, it appears at the end of the list under "All sessions." However, this behavior is not consistent when filtering sessions by day.
	 
Improvements to Consider:

 1 Introduce input fields for Room Number and Start Time during session submission to ensure complete and accurate data entry.
 2 Ensure that the UI dynamically updates to display the selected day's sessions when filtering by day.
 3 Implement consistent behavior for displaying newly submitted sessions, regardless of the filtering criteria applied.
